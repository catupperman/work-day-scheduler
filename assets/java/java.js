//Psudo: GOAL: daily planner to create a schedule
//TODO: the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, with running time.
//Use moment to generate current date and time.


// scroll down  (scroll bar needed?)
//TODO: timeblocks for standard business hours
//JQuery to build type in blocks with a standard save button


// TODO: each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
//set three classes past present future
//create a function with the variable of the current time, compare to the time set on the buttons to express different colors
//past- gray
//present- red
//future- green


//TO DO: click into a timeblock to enter an event, with click save to local storage
//JSON elements for local storage, click events to save to the local storage 
//onclick or maybe eventListener... on click is more inclusive to apply to each button as opposed to just one. 



//TODO: WHEN refreshing the page, the saved events persist
